# SpecialLib

SpecialLib is a part-fork off of my previous library called JExternalPlugin,

This version contains more features and has more improvements.

## SpecialEvent

SpecialEvent is an event library that uses annotations!

## SpecialPlugin

SpecialPlugin allows modularity in applications. Together with SpecialEvent makes this a powerfull library!

## SpecialUtil

SpecialUtil is a library that contains some utility methods that the library needs/that you can use.

## SpecialNative

SpecialNative brings native-only features to Java by using JNI with JNA.
I barely have any knowledge of C so please contact me if you know C & JNI(Specialists only).

## Feature Request

If you have any feature requests please pull a request or pm me on HF.

## Contribute

If you want to contribute to this library you MUST be a member of the specialists. 
I will not accept anyone else(No exceptions made).

## Dependencies

This library does not need any dependencies other than the JVM. However if you want to use databases you need XerialJDBC.
If you want to run scala plugins you have to add the scala runtime to your buildpath.

Both libraries can be found in the lib folder.
