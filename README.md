# SpecialLib

This project is part-fork of my previous project called JExternalPlugin.

This library allows Java developers to easily implement plugins, events and more in their project,

## SpecialPlugin

This library allows you to load plugins. These plugins can be made by anyone.

## SpecialEvent

Cool event library based off of Google Guava

## Got a feature request?

If you have a feature request please pm me.

## Dependencies
This library doesn't require any dependencies. If you want to use a sql you need to include the xerial-jdbc jar.
If you want to program plugins in scala you need to add the scala runtime to your project build path.
